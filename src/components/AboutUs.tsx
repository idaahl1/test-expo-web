          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            TaskManager was born from the need for a simple, elegant task management 
            solution. We noticed that existing tools were either too complex or too 
            basic. So we set out to create the perfect balance - powerful enough for 
            serious productivity, yet simple enough for anyone to use.
